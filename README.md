# Jarvis

## What is it : 
Jarvis is an assistant that allows you to control your Spotify or Deezer music via a joystick or your voice (the voice controlled version shows failures and is not finished) 
This is a crossover project with Arduino and Python. 
The actual version uses the keyboard control but a new version using the Deezer and Spotify API is coming up. 
Thus, a User Interface will also be built up. 

## How to run : 
Plug in an arduino uno with StandardFirmata on it and a joystick plugged like this : 
  X axis : A0
  Y axis : A1
  SW : A2
Enter the Serial USB port name in Jarvis/with joystick/v2
Run main file of this folder. 

## TODO : 
make a bluetooth version to remotely control the music.
